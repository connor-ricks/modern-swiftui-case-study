# `Standups.app` Overview
## What is `Standups.app`?
Standups is a small application that allows the user to manage and record their daily standups.

## `StandupsList` Feature
A user can view all of their standups and create new ones. Standups are persisted to disk so that they can be loaded on each launch of the application.
