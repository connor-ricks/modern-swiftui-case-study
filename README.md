# Modern SwiftUI - Case Study

This application is a case study of Apple's  [Apple's Scrumdinger application](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger). 
The objective is to outline what it takes to build a **vanilla** SwiftUI application with the best, modern practices. The foundation of this case study in SwiftUI architecture was built upon the series called [Modern SwiftUI by PointFree](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/swiftui/modern-swiftui). The application provides a small example of a decently complex application that tackles real-world problems, in a way that can be tested, and isolated using all of Swift's powerful domain modeling tools.

From the foundation created by PointFree, This project has been updated to go beyond what it means to follow modern best practices and architecture to outline things like structure, and modularity.
